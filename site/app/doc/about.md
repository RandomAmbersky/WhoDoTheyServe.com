### About

WhoDoTheyServe.com is a non-profit [opensource] effort to map the
global political, financial and corporate power structure at the highest levels.
A secondary purpose is to highlight possible [conflict of interest][coi].

All actors and connections are backed up with evidence.

This site is experimental and open to new ideas/suggestions which
you can add to [github issues][issues].

### Contribute

If you feel like contributing then please login using your Facebook, Google or Github
account (you can delete your user account at any time).

Any actors and connections you add are shared and usable by other contributors, and your
maps are viewable by anyone.

This feature is currently in beta test so please log any issues to [github issues][issues].

### Data

The data is freely available in [JSON] format via an [API]:
[nodes](http://wdts10.eu01.aws.af.cm/api/nodes)
[edges](http://wdts10.eu01.aws.af.cm/api/edges)
[evidences](http://wdts10.eu01.aws.af.cm/api/evidences)
[users](http://wdts10.eu01.aws.af.cm/api/users)

A [production database dump][db-dump] is maintained in github.

### Privacy

This site does not use 3rd party tracking tools like Google analytics.
The only information captured is
[visitor count per 10-days](http://wdts10.eu01.aws.af.cm/api/hive/n-hits-2014).
