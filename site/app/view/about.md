### About

WhoDoTheyServe.com is a non-profit [opensource] effort to map the
global political, financial and corporate power structure at the highest levels.
A secondary purpose is to highlight possible [conflict of interest][coi].

All actors and connections are backed up with evidence.

This site is experimental and open to new ideas/suggestions which
you can add to [github issues][issues].

### Data

The data is freely available in [JSON] format via an [API]:
<a class='api'>nodes</a>
<a class='api'>edges</a>
<a class='api'>evidences</a>
<a class='api'>maps</a>
<a class='api'>users</a>

A [production database dump][db-dump] is maintained in github.

### Privacy

This site does not use 3rd party tracking tools like Google analytics.
The only information captured is <a class='n-hits'>visitor count per 10-days</a>
